// We want to create and extract information about your favorite sports team.
// Itâ€™s your job to create data using the JavaScript data structures at your disposal: arrays, objects, etc.

// Once created, you can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from them.
// For example, you might want to get the total number of games your team has played, 
// or the average score of all of their games.
